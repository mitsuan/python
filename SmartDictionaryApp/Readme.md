# Intro
  This python app uses various online dictionary APIs to get the meaning and other details of the entered word.
  
  ## But, how is it smart???
  It stores the searched word in the database and helps the user remember the word by asking the meaning of the word at a particular frequency e.g once in 2 days. If the answer is correct the frequency of that word reduces and increases otherwise.
    
    
# APIs used
  Till now only the Oxford dictionary API has been integrated and only the "search" facility has been provided. The smartness feature is under development.
